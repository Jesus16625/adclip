N.B. This is not an officially supported Google product

## Solution Overview

AdClip leverages Google's state-of-the-art AI to help advertisers adopt short-form creatives. It uses three AI technologies:

- Generative AI to identify and trim the most important ideas from a video transcript.
- Video Intelligence to understand the video's content and context.
- Speech to text to transcribe the video's audio.

AdClip uses these technologies to:

- Make short-form content that is short, fun, and easy to digest.
- Produce multiple versions of transcripts from the same videos, allowing advertisers to test different narratives for different types of campaigns.

## Implementation

AdClip is a full-stack web application built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It offers a self-service UI that gives users a consistent and intuitive flow to generate short-form vertical and landscape videos from an existing long-form landscape video. AdClip is also open source, so advertisers can deploy it in their own GCP environment and integrate it to their own CMS if needed.
